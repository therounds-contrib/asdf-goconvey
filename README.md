# Dependencies

This plugin depends on common POSIX utilities (`awk`, `grep`, `sed`, etc.),
Bash, Git, and Go. If you have a Go toolchain installed and selected via asdf
(`asdf current golang`), it will be used to retrieve and build goconvey.
Otherwise, asdf will be used to retrieve the latest Go version and that will be
used for the build.

# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add goconvey https://github.com/therounds-contrib/asdf-goconvey.git
```

goconvey:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all goconvey

# Install specific version
asdf install goconvey latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global goconvey latest

# Now goconvey commands are available
goconvey -help
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.
